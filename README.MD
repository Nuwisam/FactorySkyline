# Factory Skyline

Factory Skyline is a currently un-working mod first created by [Cepheidqq](https://github.com/cepheidqq). The mod currently is not supported currently by update 4 to Satisfactory.

The mod allowed for a quick and easy method to copy and paste large setups with ease along with a blueprint save option. 

## Current status

Currently as stated above the mod doesn't work with update 4. 

[Cepheidqq](https://github.com/cepheidqq) after some pestering decided to release the source code of the mod to the public in the hope it can be updated. he made this statement in this [post](https://github.com/cepheidqq/FactorySkyline/issues/47):


```
Hi everyone,
I just upload my source code of this mod. You can download it at: https://github.com/cepheidqq/FactorySkyline/blob/main/FactorySkylineSourceCode.zip

I know it does not work in the lastest version of the Satisfactory. But I think it will be helpful to other modders. It uses some hack methods to call the API of the FactoryGame Library, and the .h files in /FactoryGame are also be modified by this mod. Well, it does not mean this mod hacked the game, it just hacks the compiler. I'm not sure it also works in the lastest version of the game, this is why I can't maintain a branch of this project at github, but I can show you all my source code.

I love this game, it gives me lots of fun, and I love this mod too, I didn't make it to be a business project. But I found that I cannot used the discord due to the great firewall, and the community almost completly works on it. It was a heavy blow to me, and sometimes I even can not open the github. I hope it can be changed in a few years. â€‹

I'm still a player of the Satisfactory Game. Hopes everybody have a good time:)
```


Currently, my plan is to hopefully 
1) Make some noise about this mod going open source.
2) Start a discussion with interested people about the feasibility of updating this mod.
3) Assemble and manage a team to carry out this work.

To join in on this discussion I've set up a discord server [here](https://discord.gg/vuFK7tsrE3) where we can talk about the future of this mod.

I plan to keep this mod fully open-sourced community-driven, it's too awesome to let die!
